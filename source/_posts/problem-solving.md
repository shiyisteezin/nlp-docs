### More on Logic And Problem Solving


In a different [blog](https://shiyis.github.io/nlpwme/modules/1h-semantics/), I have briefly introduced some of the most important concepts of logic and problem solving, including but not limited to predicate calculus, propositional logic, and lambda calculus.

In this blog, the notes will be more in detail and introduce relevant ideas.


#### Defining Entailment, Implicatures, and Presuppositions


**Implicatures**: What's suggested in an utterance, even though it is not explicitly stated or entailed by the utterance.

**Entailment**: Entailment is a relationship between statements where one statement necessarily follows from another. If statement A entails statement B, then if A is true, B must also be true.

**Presuppositions**: A presupposition is an assumption that as speaker makes about what the listener already knows or believes to be true. It's information taken for granted in the utterance.


#### Differences Between The Above Three


Let's define implicatures, entailments, and presuppositions and compare their differences in simple terms

_**Nature of Meaning**_:

  - **Implicature**: Implied meaning that relies on context and shared understanding. It is not directly stated but inferred.
  - **Entailment**: Logical meaning that follows necessarily from the truth of another statement. It is a strict logical relationship.
  - **Presupposition**: Assumed background information or beliefs. It is taken for granted by the speaker as known to the listener.

_**Dependence on Context**_:
  - **Implicature**: Highly dependent on context. The same statement can imply different things in different situations.
  - **Entailment**: Not dependent on context. If the antecedent is true, the consequent must be true regardless of context.
  - **Presupposition**: Partially dependent on context. It relies on shared knowledge but is less flexible than implicature.

_**Truth Conditions**_:
  - **Implicature**: Can be canceled or denied without contradiction. For example, "It’s cold in here" doesn’t necessarily mean the speaker wants the window closed if they follow up with, "But I like it that way."
  - **Entailment**:
  Cannot be canceled without contradiction. If "All cats are animals" is true, saying "No cats are animals" would be a direct contradiction.
  - **Presupposition**: Remains even if the statement is negated. For example, "John's brother is not tall" still presupposes that John has a brother.

_**Example Comparisons**_:
  - **Implicature**:
  Statement: "Can you pass the salt?"
  Implicature: The speaker is asking you to pass the salt, not questioning your ability to do so.
  - **Entailment**:
  Statement: "She is a mother."
  Entailment: She has a child. If "She is a mother" is true, it logically follows that "She has a child" must be true.
  - **Presupposition**:
  Statement: "The king of France is bald."
  Presupposition: There is a king of France. This assumption is taken for granted by the speaker.

#### Summary

**Implicatures** are implied meanings that depend on context and can be canceled without contradiction.
**Entailments** are logical consequences that must be true if the initial statement is true, and they cannot be canceled without contradiction.
**Presuppositions** are background assumptions that remain true even if the statement is negated and depend on shared knowledge between the speaker and listener.
By understanding these differences, we can better analyze and interpret the subtleties of communication and language use.



#### The Gists of Predicate Calculus and Propositional Logic


#### Basic Concepts of Lambda Calculus
Lambda calculus is a formal system in mathematical logic and computer science for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. It was introduced by Alonzo Church in the 1930s as part of his work on the foundations of mathematics.


#### 1. **Lambda Abstraction**:
  - **Syntax**: `λx. E`
  - **Explanation**: This denotes an anonymous function with a parameter `x` and body `E`. For example, `λx. x + 1` represents a function that takes an argument `x` and returns `x + 1`.

#### 2. **Application**:
  - **Syntax**: `(F A)`
  - **Explanation**: This denotes the application of function `F` to argument `A`. For example, `(λx. x + 1) 2` applies the function `λx. x + 1` to `2`, resulting in `3`.

#### 3. **Variables**:
  - **Syntax**: `x`
  - **Explanation**: Variables are placeholders for values or other expressions. In `λx. x`, `x` is a variable.

#### Expressions

In lambda calculus, expressions are built using variables, lambda abstractions, and applications. These are called lambda expressions or terms. The grammar of lambda expressions is defined as:

 - **Variables**: `x, y, z, ...`
 - **Lambda Abstraction**: `λx. E` where `x` is a variable and `E` is a lambda expression.
 - **Application**: `(E1 E2)` where `E1` and `E2` are lambda expressions.

#### Reduction

Lambda calculus defines computation through the process of **reduction**, which simplifies lambda expressions. There are two main types of reduction:

1. **Alpha Conversion (α conversion)**:
    **Explanation**: Renaming the bound variables in a lambda expression. For example, `λx. x` can be alpha-converted to `λy. y`.
    **Purpose**: Avoids name collisions.

2. **Beta Reduction (β reduction)**:
    **Explanation**: Applying a lambda function to an argument. For example, `(λx. x + 1) 2` reduces to `2 + 1` which further reduces to `3`.
    **Process**: Replace the bound variable with the argument in the body of the abstraction. `(λx. E1) E2` reduces to `E1[E2/x]`, where `E1[E2/x]` denotes substitution of `E2` for `x` in `E1`.

#### Example of Beta Reduction

Consider the expression: `(λx. (λy. x + y) 2) 3`.

1. Apply the outer function `(λx. (λy. x + y) 2)` to `3`:
    `((λx. (λy. x + y) 2) 3)`
    Substitute `3` for `x` in `(λy. x + y) 2`: `(λy. 3 + y) 2`.

2. Apply the inner function `(λy. 3 + y)` to `2`:
    `((λy. 3 + y) 2)`
    Substitute `2` for `y` in `3 + y`: `3 + 2`.

3. Simplify the expression:
    `3 + 2` reduces to `5`.

#### Significance in Computer Science

Lambda calculus serves as the foundation for understanding computation and functional programming languages. Key aspects include:

 - **Functional Programming**: Languages like Haskell, Lisp, and Scheme are heavily influenced by lambda calculus.
 - **Programming Language Theory**: Lambda calculus provides a framework for studying the properties of functions and recursive definitions.
 - **Type Systems**: Extensions of lambda calculus, such as the simply typed lambda calculus, form the basis for type systems in programming languages.

#### Church-Turing (Alonzo Church and Alan Turing) Thesis

Lambda calculus is also central to the **Church-Turing thesis**, which posits that any computable function can be computed by a Turing machine, and equivalently, can be expressed in lambda calculus. This establishes lambda calculus as a universal model of computation.

In summary, lambda calculus is a powerful mathematical formalism for defining and studying computation. Its simplicity and expressiveness make it a cornerstone of theoretical computer science and a valuable tool for understanding the base of programming languages.

#### In A Nutshell

The contributions of **Alonzo Church** and **Alan Turing**, particularly their work on the **Church-Turing thesis** and the development of **lambda calculus** and **Turing machines**, can be discussed under the broader umbrella of **problem-solving** and **logical reasoning**. Their ideas fit well within the same conceptual framework as **traditional syllogistic logic**, such as **propositional logic** and **predicate logic**, since all of these approaches are aimed at formalizing methods of reasoning and solving problems in structured, logical ways.
