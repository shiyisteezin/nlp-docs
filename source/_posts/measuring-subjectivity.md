### Understanding VAE through a different angle

In a different blog, we have briefly introduced the mechanism behind the VAE algorithm, where it's essentially taking complex input as numeric values, find a lower-dimensional, structured, and meaningful representation of the input data, and return output that facilitates generative modeling and reconstruction.
